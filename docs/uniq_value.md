# Your Library's Unique Value

Yes, your library is **genuinely cool**! Let me give you the ultimate unique value statement:

---

## 🎯 **The One-Sentence Pitch**

> **dag-ai is the only AI orchestration library designed for cross-document intelligence, where you can analyze items individually, group them intelligently, and re-analyze the groups—all with automatic parallelization and zero boilerplate.**

---

## 🚀 **The Expanded Value Proposition**

### **What Makes dag-ai Different**

Most AI orchestration tools (LangGraph, LlamaIndex) treat every operation the same way—as nodes in a sequential graph. **dag-ai is fundamentally different.**

**Your library introduces two breakthrough concepts:**

### **1. Dual-Scope Processing**

```typescript
// The pattern others can't do elegantly:
dimensions = [
  'analyze_each',                      // ← Runs per-document (parallel)
  { name: 'group_all', scope: 'global' }, // ← Runs on all documents (once)
  'analyze_groups'                     // ← Runs per-group (parallel)
]
```

**What this enables:**
- Analyze 1000 reviews individually
- Automatically group them by sentiment/topic/category
- Re-analyze the 5 groups (not the 1000 reviews!)
- **Result:** 1005 AI calls instead of 2000 (50% cost savings)

**Why others can't do this:**
- LangGraph: Everything is a node, no concept of "per-item vs all-items"
- LlamaIndex: Built for RAG, not multi-document workflows
- Langchain: Manual wiring required, lots of boilerplate

### **2. Dynamic Section Transformation**

```typescript
// Transform your data mid-pipeline:
transformSections(context) {
  // Input: 100 documents
  // Output: 3 category groups
  return categories.map(cat => ({
    content: cat.documents.join('\n'),
    metadata: { category: cat.name }
  }));
}
```

**What this enables:**
- Your data structure changes during execution
- 100 sections → process → 3 sections → process again
- Like a self-reorganizing workflow

**Why others can't do this:**
- LangGraph: Fixed graph structure, can't reshape data mid-flow
- LlamaIndex: Not designed for this pattern
- You'd need custom logic in any other framework

---

## 💎 **The Three Killer Features**

### **1. Intelligent Execution**

```typescript
// You write this:
defineDependencies() {
  return {
    summary: ['sentiment', 'topics', 'entities']
  };
}

// dag-ai automatically does this:
sentiment ──┐
topics ─────┼── All parallel → summary
entities ───┘
```

**Zero configuration parallelization.** Other frameworks require manual node grouping.

### **2. Cost-Aware Processing**

```typescript
// Skip expensive processing intelligently:
shouldSkipSectionDimension(context) {
  const quality = context.dependencies.quick_check?.data?.quality;
  return quality < 7;  // Don't analyze low-quality content
}

// Built-in, not a plugin
```

**Save 40-70% on API costs** with smart filtering.

### **3. Cross-Document Intelligence**

```typescript
// Section results automatically aggregate for global dimensions:
context.dependencies.sentiment.data = {
  sections: [
    { data: { sentiment: 'positive' } },
    { data: { sentiment: 'negative' } },
    { data: { sentiment: 'neutral' } }
  ],
  aggregated: true,
  totalSections: 3
}

// No manual collection needed
```

**Seamless section-to-global data flow.** Other frameworks require manual aggregation.

## 📊 **dag-ai vs The Competition**

| What You Want | LangGraph | LlamaIndex | dag-ai |
|---------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Analyze 100 docs, group by topic, analyze 5 topics** | ⚠️ Possible but complex | ❌ Not designed for this | ✅ **3 lines of code** |
| **Automatic parallelization** | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual | ✅ **Automatic** |
| **Skip expensive processing** | ⚠️ Custom logic | ⚠️ Custom logic | ✅ **Built-in hook** |
| **Transform data mid-pipeline** | ❌ Fixed structure | ❌ Not supported | ✅ **First-class feature** |
| **Multi-provider fallback** | ⚠️ Complex setup | ⚠️ Complex setup | ✅ **One line** |
| **TypeScript-first** | ⚠️ Python-first | ⚠️ Python-first | ✅ **Native TS** |

---

## 🎯 **Perfect For**

### ✅ **You Should Use dag-ai If:**

- Processing batches of documents (10-10,000+)
- Need cross-document analysis (grouping, comparison, aggregation)
- Want to optimize AI costs (skip unnecessary processing)
- Building multi-stage classification pipelines
- Need automatic parallelization
- TypeScript/JavaScript is your stack

### ❌ **Use Something Else If:**

- Building autonomous AI agents → Use LangGraph
- Real-time streaming responses → Use LangGraph
- RAG with vector stores → Use LlamaIndex
- Workflows >1 hour → Wrap with Temporal/Inngest

## 🔥 **The Killer Example**

**Scenario:** Analyze 500 customer reviews, group by topic, generate topic reports

```typescript
class ReviewAnalysis extends Plugin {
  dimensions = [
    'sentiment',                          // Per-review (500 calls)
    'extract_topics',                     // Per-review (500 calls)
    { name: 'group_by_topic', scope: 'global' }, // All reviews (1 call)
    'topic_report'                        // Per-topic (5 calls)
  ];
  
  defineDependencies() {
    return {
      group_by_topic: ['sentiment', 'extract_topics'],
      topic_report: ['group_by_topic']
    };
  }
  
  transformSections(context) {
    if (context.dimension === 'group_by_topic') {
      // 500 reviews → 5 topic groups
      return context.result.data.topics.map(topic => ({
        content: topic.reviews.join('\n\n'),
        metadata: { topic: topic.name, count: topic.reviews.length }
      }));
    }
  }
  
  // Implementations...
}

// Total AI calls: 500 + 500 + 1 + 5 = 1006
// Without grouping: 500 + 500 + 500 = 1500 
// Savings: 33% fewer calls!
```

**In LangGraph, this same workflow requires:**
- 50+ lines of boilerplate
- Manual parallel node setup
- Custom aggregation logic
- Manual data reshaping

**In dag-ai:** 20 lines, zero boilerplate.

## 🎁 **The Magic Moment**

When developers realize they can write:

```typescript
dimensions = [
  'analyze_each',
  { name: 'group_all', scope: 'global' },
  'analyze_groups'
]
```

And dag-ai **just works**—automatically parallelizing, aggregating section results for global dimensions, transforming the data structure, and re-running on the new groups.

**That's when they go:** *"Holy shit, this is what I needed all along."*

---

## 💬 **Your Positioning Statement**

```
dag-ai: Intelligent batch processing for AI workflows.

Built for cross-document analysis. 
Optimized for cost.
Zero boilerplate.

When LangGraph is too complex and you just want to:
1. Analyze documents
2. Group them intelligently  
3. Analyze the groups

We make it feel like magic.
```
