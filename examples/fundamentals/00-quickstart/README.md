**What happened?**

- Pipeline processed 20 customer reviews through 6 dimensions
- Spam filter (Haiku) detected 10 spam reviews and skipped downstream analysis
- Sentiment and categorization ran in parallel on 10 legitimate reviews
- Reviews grouped by category (features, performance, pricing, support, UX)
- Deep analysis (Sonnet) generated insights per category (5 categories)
- Executive summary (Sonnet) synthesized findings into actionable priorities
- Skip logic saved 20 API calls (30% efficiency gain)

## Code Walkthrough

The pipeline combines skip logic, parallel execution, transformations, and multi-model selection into a production-ready workflow.

```typescript
class ReviewAnalyzer extends Plugin {
	constructor() {
		super(
			"review-analyzer",
			"Review Analyzer",
			"Production review analysis"
		);

		this.dimensions = [
			"filter_spam",        // Stage 1: Detect spam
			"sentiment",          // Stage 2: Parallel analysis
			"categorize",         // Stage 2: Parallel analysis
			{
				name: "group_by_category",  // Stage 3: Transform data
				scope: "global",
				transform: this.groupByCategory.bind(this)
			},
			"analyze_category",   // Stage 4: Deep insights per category
			{
				name: "executive_summary",  // Stage 5: Synthesize findings
				scope: "global"
			}
		];
	}

	defineDependencies(): Record<string, string[]> {
		return {
			sentiment: ["filter_spam"],
			categorize: ["filter_spam"],
			group_by_category: ["categorize"],
			analyze_category: ["group_by_category"],
			executive_summary: ["analyze_category"]
		};
	}
}
```

**Key point:** Six dimensions execute in five stages. Stages 1-2 process individual reviews. Stage 3 transforms data. Stages 4-5 analyze grouped data.

### Step 1: Skip spam in downstream dimensions
```typescript
shouldSkipSectionDimension(ctx: SectionDimensionContext): boolean {
	if (ctx.dimension === "sentiment" || ctx.dimension === "categorize") {
		const spamCheck = ctx.dependencies.filter_spam as 
			DimensionResult<SpamCheckResult> | undefined;
		
		if (spamCheck?.data?.is_spam) {
			const content = ctx.section.content.slice(0, 50);
			console.log(`⏭️  Skipped [${ctx.dimension}] for spam: "${content}..."`);
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
}
```

**Key point:** The `shouldSkipSectionDimension` hook checks spam filter results and skips analysis for spam reviews. This saved 20 API calls (10 spam reviews × 2 dimensions).

### Step 2: Transform individual reviews into category groups
```typescript
groupByCategory(
	result: DimensionResult,
	sections: SectionData[]
): SectionData[] {
	const categories = new Map<string, string[]>();

	sections.forEach((section, index) => {
		const categoryResult = result.sections?.[index]?.results.categorize;
		const category = categoryResult?.data?.category || "uncategorized";

		if (!categories.has(category)) {
			categories.set(category, []);
		}
		categories.get(category)!.push(section.content);
	});

	return Array.from(categories.entries()).map(([category, reviews]) => ({
		content: reviews.join("\n\n"),
		metadata: { category, count: reviews.length }
	}));
}
```

**Key point:** The `transform` function converts individual reviews into category groups. Instead of analyzing 10 reviews individually, the pipeline analyzes 5 category groups.

### Step 3: Route dimensions to appropriate models
```typescript
selectProvider(dimension: string): ProviderSelection {
	// Use Haiku for filtering and categorization
	if (dimension === "filter_spam" || 
	    dimension === "sentiment" || 
	    dimension === "categorize" ||
	    dimension === "group_by_category") {
		return {
			provider: "anthropic",
			options: {
				model: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",  // $0.80/$4.00 per 1M tokens
				temperature: 0.2
			}
		};
	}

	// Use Sonnet for deep analysis and synthesis
	return {
		provider: "anthropic",
		options: {
			model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",  // $3.00/$15.00 per 1M tokens
			temperature: 0.3
		}
	};
}
```

**Key point:** Cheap Haiku model handles filtering and categorization (37 of 47 API calls). Expensive Sonnet model handles deep insights (6 of 47 API calls). This balance optimizes cost and quality.

### Step 4: Configure engine with pricing
```typescript
const PRICING = {
	"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022": { inputPer1M: 0.80, outputPer1M: 4.00 },
	"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022": { inputPer1M: 3.00, outputPer1M: 15.00 }
};

const engine = new DagEngine({
	plugin: new ReviewAnalyzer(),
	providers: {
		anthropic: { apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY! }
	},
	execution: {
		pricing: { models: PRICING },
		concurrency: 5  // Process 5 dimensions in parallel (default: 5)
	}
});

const result = await engine.process(reviews);
```

**Key point:** The `execution.pricing` config enables automatic cost tracking. The engine calculates costs per dimension and provides detailed breakdowns.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Five-Stage Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline processes data through five distinct stages.
```
Stage 1: Filter Spam (20 reviews)
   ↓
Stage 2: Parallel Analysis (10 reviews, spam filtered)
   sentiment + categorize run simultaneously
   ↓
Stage 3: Group by Category (10 reviews → 5 categories)
   transform reshapes data
   ↓
Stage 4: Deep Analysis (5 category groups)
   analyze_category runs per group
   ↓
Stage 5: Executive Summary (1 global synthesis)
   executive_summary synthesizes all findings
```

**Characteristics:**

- Stages 1-2 operate on individual reviews (section dimensions)
- Stage 3 transforms data structure via global dimension with transform
- Stages 4-5 operate on transformed data (section then global)
- Dependencies ensure correct execution order
- Parallelism within stages improves performance

### 2. Skip Logic for Cost Optimization

Skip logic prevents unnecessary API calls on low-value data.
```typescript
shouldSkipSectionDimension(ctx: SectionDimensionContext): boolean {
	if (ctx.dimension === "sentiment" || ctx.dimension === "categorize") {
		const spamCheck = ctx.dependencies.filter_spam;
		if (spamCheck?.data?.is_spam) {
			return true;  // Skip analysis on spam
		}
	}
	return false;
}
```

**Impact in this example:**

- 10 spam reviews detected by filter_spam
- 2 dependent dimensions (sentiment, categorize) skipped per spam review
- 20 API calls saved (10 reviews × 2 dimensions)
- 30% efficiency gain (20 saved / 67 total possible calls)

### 3. Data Transformations for Smart Grouping

Transformations reshape data between dimensions.
```typescript
{
	name: "group_by_category",
	scope: "global",
	transform: (result, sections) => {
		// Convert: 10 individual reviews → 5 category groups
		return groupByCategory(result, sections);
	}
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Reduces analysis from 10 individual reviews to 5 category groups
- Enables pattern recognition across similar reviews
- Generates insights at category level rather than review level
- More actionable output for product teams

### 4. Multi-Model Strategy

Use cheap models for simple tasks, expensive models for complex analysis.

**Cost breakdown by model:**

- Haiku (41 calls): $0.0159 for filtering, sentiment, categorization
- Sonnet (6 calls): $0.0123 for deep insights and synthesis
- Total: $0.0282 for 47 API calls

**If using only Sonnet:**

- 47 calls × ~$0.002 per call = ~$0.094
- 3.3x more expensive than multi-model approach

**If using only Haiku:**

- Cost would be lower (~$0.016)
- But insights would lack depth and nuance
- Actionable recommendations would be generic

### 5. Real-Time Cost Tracking

Track spending automatically with detailed breakdowns.
```typescript
const result = await engine.process(reviews);

console.log(result.costs);
// {
//   totalCost: 0.0282,
//   totalTokens: 12289,
//   byDimension: {
//     filter_spam: { cost: 0.0115, tokens: 8107, model: "Haiku" },
//     sentiment: { cost: 0.0015, tokens: 934, model: "Haiku" },
//     // ...
//   },
//   byProvider: {
//     anthropic: { cost: 0.0282, tokens: 12289, models: ["Haiku", "Sonnet"] }
//   }
// }
```

**What you can track:**

- Total cost and tokens across all dimensions
- Cost per dimension with model information
- Cost per provider (useful when using multiple providers)
- Token breakdown (input vs output)

## Production Patterns Demonstrated

### Pattern 1: Quality Filter

Cheap model filters bad data, expensive model analyzes good data.
```typescript
this.dimensions = [
	"quality_check",    // Haiku: Fast, cheap filter
	"deep_analysis"     // Sonnet: Expensive, high quality
];

shouldSkipSectionDimension(ctx) {
	const quality = ctx.dependencies.quality_check?.data?.quality_score;
	return quality < 0.7;  // Skip low-quality items
}
```

**Use cases:** Content moderation, lead qualification, document triage

### Pattern 2: Parallel Independent Tasks

Run multiple independent analyses simultaneously.
```typescript
this.dimensions = [
	"check_spam",       // Runs first
	"sentiment",        // Runs in parallel with categorize
	"categorize"        // Runs in parallel with sentiment
];

defineDependencies() {
	return {
		sentiment: ["check_spam"],
		categorize: ["check_spam"]  // Both depend only on check_spam
	};
}
```

**Use cases:** Multi-aspect analysis, independent feature extraction

### Pattern 3: Progressive Aggregation

Transform individual items into groups, analyze groups, synthesize globally.
```typescript
this.dimensions = [
	"analyze_item",           // Section: individual items
	{
		name: "group_items",    // Global: aggregate items
		scope: "global",
		transform: groupingLogic
	},
	"analyze_group",          // Section: grouped items
	{
		name: "synthesize",     // Global: final synthesis
		scope: "global"
	}
];
```

**Use cases:** Survey analysis, review analysis, multi-document synthesis

## Summary

**What you learned:**

✅ **Skip logic** - Filter spam and skip dependent analyses (saved 20 API calls, 30% efficiency gain)  
✅ **Parallel execution** - Sentiment and categorization ran simultaneously  
✅ **Transformations** - Converted 10 reviews into 5 category groups for smarter analysis  
✅ **Multi-model orchestration** - Haiku for filtering, Sonnet for insights ($0.0282 vs $0.094 if using only Sonnet)  
✅ **Cost tracking** - Real-time breakdown by dimension and model

**Key insight:**

Production pipelines combine multiple optimization strategies to balance cost, quality, and performance. This example used skip logic to avoid wasting API calls on spam (30% efficiency gain), transformations to enable category-level analysis instead of individual review analysis, and multi-model selection to use cheap models for simple tasks and expensive models only where needed (saving 70% vs using Sonnet everywhere). The result is a pipeline that processes 20 reviews into actionable business insights for $0.03 in 24 seconds.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Not Set
```
Error: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found
```

**Cause:** Missing environment variable.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Option 2: Add to .env file
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." >> .env
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded (429)
```

**Cause:** Too many concurrent requests.

**Fix:**
```typescript
const engine = new DagEngine({
	plugin: new ReviewAnalyzer(),
	execution: {
		concurrency: 2  // Reduce from default 5 to 2
	}
});
```

### Cost Tracking Shows $0
```
💰 Total Cost: $0.0000
```

**Cause:** Missing pricing configuration.

**Fix:**
```typescript
const engine = new DagEngine({
	plugin: new ReviewAnalyzer(),
	execution: {
		pricing: {
			models: {
				'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022': { inputPer1M: 0.80, outputPer1M: 4.00 },
				'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': { inputPer1M: 3.00, outputPer1M: 15.00 }
			}
		}
	}
});
```

### Transform Not Applied
```
Expected 5 category groups but got 10 individual reviews
```

**Cause:** Transform function not bound correctly or not returning new sections.

**Fix:**
```typescript
{
	name: "group_by_category",
	scope: "global",
	transform: this.groupByCategory.bind(this)  // Must bind 'this'
}

groupByCategory(result, sections) {
	// Must return new SectionData[] array
	return categoryGroups;
}
```
